# Lab 2.1: Preparation

This section is to be used in conjunction with Lab2, found on your vmStaging provided by the instructor. 
If you have not received access to your vmStaging environment, please reach out to your instructor for help. 
The purpose of these exercises is to get the participants familiarise with the different components for our referenced HA setup.    

Before we start setting up all the nodes in the various VMs which we have provided, we do need to prepare the associated files and their configurations. 
In this lab practice, we have taken a more organised approach in preparing a script to take the new identities which we have generated in Lab 1 and assimilated them into the HA setup.
More notably, we want the participants to focus on understanding how the various appliances interact rather than spending efforts to fidget with configurations.
It is our opinion that once you have understood how things work, would you be able to take the configurations (which you have used in this lab) and tweak them to fit your purpose.

### Exercise 1: Familiarising with our deployment
1. As with all deployment, you need to understand what we are trying to set up. 
In this lab exercise, we have prepared a simple topology using 4 VMs labelled as vmInfra1 to vmInfra4. 
Each of these VMs serve a purpose as you can see from the diagram

    ![alt text](./images/topology.jpg "Our Deployment")
    
    `vmInfra4` serves to host a node i.e. Party B, as your counter-party node in our lab exercise. To that extent, we are have not prepared an Azure SQL for Party B. 
    > **_NOTE:_** While all the participants are on the same Corda network and you could transact with one another, we do encourage you to focus on the nodes you have in hand so that you can witness the events better.
    Should you want to do a transaction with your neighbour, please feel free to do so after class.
    
2. `vmInfra1` houses the main node nodes, including the Corda firewall running as a separate bridge and float. 
The Zookeeper is for leadership election for the bridge such that at any point in time only 1 bridge is activated.
In turn, each bridge (leader) will randomly activate only 1 float at any point in time. 
Bridge does not have an `IP:PORT` as it pulls the messages from the artemis and float for outbound and inbound respectively.
As of Corda Enterprise 4, a single set of bridge float as shown in this topology supports multiple corda nodes deployed behind it. 
In our lab, we have a set of Corda firewall bridge and float supporting 2 nodes namely, Party A and Party C.

### Exercise 2: Preparing the installation script
1. In your Lab2 folder, you will have the following:
   ```
        .
        +--ConfigFiles [Folder containing the config templates]
        |  +--...
        +--Temp [Folder containing the zip of 3rd appliances e.g. artemis]
        |  +--...
        +--configure_artemis.sh [Configure the artemis in later exercises] 
        +--corda-firewall-4.4.2.jar [Corda firewall where we are going to deploy as bridge and float (both using the same jar) instance]
        +--corda-tools-ha-utilities-4.4.2.jar [Corda HA utilities to generate all the certs required for the deployment]
        +--corda-tools-health-survey-4.4.2.jar [Corda health survey tool to check connections after deployment]
        +--install.sh [Where we will configure the ports and ips]
   ```             
   In this exercise, we are going to configure the `install.sh`, which in turn will help us pull those identities which we have created in Lab1 and update with other SSL certificates which we will need to connect to the other appliances.

2. Using your favorite editor, open install.sh and examine the contents. 
Your instructor shall walk through the steps taken by the script during the install process, but for this self-guided exercise, our primary focus is on the contents below `#IP and Port for the various appliances should you want to change`.
   ```` 
        P2P_IPPORT="<Load Balancer URL for Party A and C>:10005"
        FLOAT_IPPORT="<vmInfra1 Private IP>:12005"
        FLOATLST_IPPORT="<vmInfra1 Private IP>:10005"
        FLOATPRIME_IPPORT="<vmInfra2 Private IP>:12005"
        FLOATPRIMELST_IPPORT="<vmInfra2 Private IP>:10005"
        ZOO1_IPPORT="<vmInfra1 Private IP>:11105"
        ZOO2_IPPORT="<vmInfra2 Private IP>:11105"
        ZOO3_IPPORT="<vmInfra3 Private IP>:11105"
        ARTEMISMASTER_IPPORT="<vmInfra1 Private IP>:11005"
        ARTEMISSLAVE_IPPORT="<vmInfra2 Private IP>:11005"
        #(OPTIONAL)
        PARTYBP2P_IPPORT="<Party B P2P URL>:10008"
   ````
   Referencing the worksheet provided, please go ahead to replace the vmInfra<NUMBER> with the respective IPs.
   While doing so, we do recommend that you review the topology diagram for the relevant connections.
   >**_NOTE:_** For the purpose of this class, we **do not** recommend participants changing the port number and passwords.
   While it is highly likely it will not affect the appliances, but introducing more variability undoubtedly affects the instructor experience should participants make mistakes.   
   
   Once you have completed, save and close the script.

3. The next step is to run the script and follow the prompts on the script.
It is a relatively straight forward process where you will be asked to review the IPs and URLs which you have just entered before asking for permission to run the rest of the script.
Once the script has completed, you will be greeted with 4 main folders of interest:
   ```
        .
        +--vmInfra1 [Folder containing Artemis, PartyA, PartyC, Bridge, Float and ZooKeeperOne]
        |  +--...
        +--vmInfra2 [Folder containing Artemis, PartyAPrime, PartyCParime, BridgePrime, FloatPrime and ZooKeeperTwo]
        |  +--...
        +--vmInfra3 [Folder containing ZooKeeperThree]
        |  +--...
        +--vmInfra4 [Folder containing your counterparty Party B]
        |  +--...
        +--...
   ```             
   As you have quickly observed, the script which you just ran, had assembled the required contents to each of the appliances according to the topology diagram above.
   The new identities which you have created in Lab1 corresponding to Party A, B and C are also copied into the respective folders. 
   The only difference is that we have expanded Party A and C into a full HA Hot-Cold node setup with a fail-over bridge float running on a 3rd party artemis, connected to a durable Azure SQL database.
   Whearas Party B is still running as a single node with a H2 database. Also we have updated the P2P address for all the nodes to reflect their new exposed, internet facing url.

4. The last step for this exercise is to copy each folders content from vmStaging into the respective VMs which your instructor have provided. 
If you need a reference, you could use `scp` with the following command:
   ```
        scp -r vmInfra<NUMBER>/* azureuser@<vmInfra<NUMBER> Private IP>:~/
            
        For example:
        scp -r vmInfra1/* azureuser@10.0.0.6:~/    
   ```             
   You will be prompted for the password and once entered correctly, your **contents inside the folder** will be copied into the `/home/azureuser/` folder of the respective VMs.
   We could use the private IP because we have wired up all the VMs to the virtual network on Azure. This goes for the Azure SQL server which we will connect to with Party A and C.
   Once you have completed copying the contents for each vmInfra folder to their respective host, you would have completed this section of the Lab2.
